        <h2 id="intro">Bulgaria occupies a portion of the eastern Balkan peninsula, bordering five countries—Greece and Turkey to the south, Macedonia and Serbia to the west, and Romania to the north. The most notable topographical features are the Danubian Plain, the Balkan Mountains, the Thracian Plain, and the Rhodope Mountain.</h2>

        <p>Whispers of history emanate from Bulgaria’s fortresses and ruins. Caves secreted in Bulgaria’s river-sculpted wilds hold traces of Neolithic settlements. The mysterious Thracians left behind dazzling hauls of gold and silver, and tombs that can
          be explored to this day. The Romans built cities of breathtaking scale, the bathhouses, walls and amphitheatres of which sit nonchalantly in the midst of modern cities such as Varna and Plovdiv. Successions of tsars strutted along the ramparts
          of Tsarevets Fortress at former capital Veliko Târnovo. And these histories are no less relevant today, with Thracian art and Bulgaria’s victory over the Ottomans continuing to inspire.</p>

          <h3 class="sea">The Black Sea</h3>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Long, sandy beaches and fine weather reel holidaymakers into Bulgaria’s Black Sea resorts each summer. Bulgarian inlanders are helplessly drawn to the freshening sea breeze and miles of turquoise water. Foreign visitors, too, are wise to Bulgaria’s coast, thanks to gorgeous seaside resorts such as Primorsko (and prices that compete well with Western Europe). Even the coast's two big cities, Varna and Burgas, have attractive beaches within minutes of their urban hearts. And while Sunny Beach, Sozopol and other favourites are thoroughly developed, there are still plenty of undiscovered coves north and south of the major hubs.</p>

            <!-- Mountains -->

          <h3 class="mountain">Mountains and Forests</h3>
</div>
            <p>Bulgaria’s untamed landscapes quicken the pulse of hikers, mountain bikers and skiers. Seven mountain ranges ripple across the country; glacial lakes sparkle between these snow-dusted peaks, and tangles of forest conceal wolves, bears and lynx, a glimpse of Europe’s primeval past. Networks of trails and hizhas (hiking huts) allow access to such raw beauty as mist-cloaked panoramas in the Stara Planina range and sunrise from Bulgaria’s second-highest peak, Mt Vihren (2915m). Between trekking among Rodopi villages, thundering across ski fields in Bansko or birdwatching in Pirin National Park, Bulgaria has much to delight (and exhaust) lovers of the great outdoors.</p>

          <h3 class="architecture">Bulgarian National Revival Architecture</h3>
          <div id="overlap">
        <img class="img-road" src="img/road.jpg" alt="cobble stone road">
        <img class="img-house" src="img/history.jpg" alt="Old Bulgarian house">

      </div>
            <p>The typical Bulgarian house for the period was a combination of architectural and artistic prolifically. Renaissance masters always respected nature. They protected the environment and adapted the way they built to that. This is the reason why all their works were in harmony with nature. Renaissance masters were inspired by the perfect shapes, colours and creations of nature and used their elements in carpets and embroideries, wall paintings and wood carvings in the houses they created. Despite the violent domination during Ottoman rule, Bulgarian architecture, in combination with other arts and crafts, kept alive its authenticity and unique forms because the foundations of its character and image lay in our Bulgarian traditions. Bulgarian dances, folklore songs, folklore and clothing kept the spirit of our nation and helped us survive after the Ottoman invasion.</p>

        <h3 class="churches">Churches and Religious Art</h3>
      </div>
          <p>No visitor to Bulgaria can fail to be impressed by its religious art, from vast gold-domed churches to miniature icon paintings. Sofia’s Aleksander Nevski Church and 10th-century Rila Monastery draw visitors and pilgrims galore, while Tryavna’s wood carvings and Bachkovo’s apocalyptic murals are gathering fame. But Orthodox churches in even the tiniest villages have much to admire: emotive paintings of saints, often set in carved wooden screens (iconostases), appear magical when bathed in flickering candlelight. Almost as spectacular are the settings of many sacred buildings: granite cliffs, thrashing streams and lonely mountain passes.</p>
